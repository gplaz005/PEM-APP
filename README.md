(working on Navigation branch)

The Pediatric Emergency App, or PEM App, is a smartphone application designed to assist doctors, nurses, and other medical staff in the midst of pediatric emergencies. 
Its features include a vast amount of information on some of the most common pediatric emergencies*, a search area for the user to look up a specific condition, a chatroom so the user can communicate with other users, and an area where the user can keep track of their continuing medical education. These features are provided at no cost. All that is needed is an account for the chatroom and continuing medical education tracker. 
This application was made possible with React Native, Facebookâ€™s mobile application framework. This allowed for the application to be compatible with both Android and iOS devices without having to develop for both separately. React Native is also very robust when it comes to libraries, and some were used to enable the features of this application to work at their best. Firebase was also used to manage the data that will be stored and to handle the user accounts and all their operations (account creation, signing in and out, etc).
